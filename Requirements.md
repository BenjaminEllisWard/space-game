# Space-Game Requirements

## Hard Requirements

** implemented ** Player ferries cargo through space with spaceship.
** implemented ** Cargo space is limited.
** implemented ** Different types of cargo exist for trade.
** implemented ** Player can trade cargo using monetary system based on "credits."
** implemented ** Spaceship travels at warp speed according to the equation: v(w) = w^(10/3) + (10 - w)^(-11/3) where warpfactor(w) < 10 and v is velocity in lightyears/year.
** implemented ** Trading economies on individual planets are unique.
** implemented ** Player is able to travel between a minimum of three planets, and each location is accessible from all the others. Earth is at the center of a grid system.
** implemented ** At least one planet is located in Alpha Centauri, which will be represented with a distance proportional to reality.
** implemented ** End conditions: Player runs out of money/fuel, player choice, or 40 years of game time elapse.
** implemented ** End credits: total credits at end, total credits made, time traveled.
** implemented ** Must utilize source control through Git.
** implemented ** Must use classes/objects with single domain for each class.
** implemented ** Dynamically calculated distances/speeds.
** implemented ** Minimum of 8 planets.
** implemented ** Only in-range planets are visible when traveling.
** implemented ** Minimum fuel tank can travel no more than 10 lightyears.
** implemented ** At least one route is > 50 lightyears (OtherPlanet to OtherPlanet8 is over 50 ly).
** implemented ** Several commits from each team member.



## Stretch Goals 

** implemented ** Ship customization
** implemented ** Fluctuating economies
** NOT implemented ** Ship degradation
** NOT implemented ** Randomly generated planets
